# Instructions
## Installing Portable Git

A portable version of Git is the first thing you'll need. Git can be installed from https://git-scm.com/downloads.

You will see something like this. The Super Duper Vanilla Installer is made for Windows, so click the Windows icon. If you're not on Windows, sorry!

After clicking the Windows icon, it will download something.

Cancel the download, since that's not the version of Git that we want. Instead, we want the portable version of Git.

Click the version that's compatible with your computer (Most likely the 64 bit version if you're on a modern computer.) This will start a download for portable Git installer which you should keep if you're confused.

Now this is what you should have in your downloads folder or whatever folder you downloaded the installer in.

Now run the installer.

If it asks you this, don't change the directory unless the directory isn't inside your current directory and click "Ok".

Let it finish installing, and you'll see there's a new folder called PortableGit.

Move the PortableGit folder inside the Super Duper Vanilla Installer folder, and you've just finished installing a portable version of Git inside the Super Duper Vanilla Installer.

Your Super Duper Vanilla Installer folder should look like this.

## Installing Java

Java can be installed from https:///www.java.com/en/download or https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html.

If you're download from oracle.com, remember to choose the JDK download.

Scroll down and you'll find a lot of options for installers, find one that's for your computer. But remember, this installer was made for Windows.

If you're installing from java.com, just click download and it will download an installer for you.

Both of these will download an installer, so just run the installer, and it will install Java on your computer.

## Running the Super Duper Vanilla installer

To run the installer, simple double click the run.bat file in File Explorer.

It will open the command prompt, which will run Java and install Super Duper Vanilla. It should be a quick installation.

Remember that this is still a prototype, so there are still some things that need to be added, and if you run it more than once, it won't download and replace the already downloaded files, so you're going to have to delete them yourself.
